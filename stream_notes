From 25c3

Are the streams not working? Then please check on these things:

    * Are there any lectures right now? Check the schedule! (add link to it!)
    * Is the (internal) network up and running? (link to status.xml de icecast?)
    * Is there no data from the streams? (no entiendo esta pregunta, es muy abierta)

If there actually are lectures happening, the network is up and there is yet no data - only then call the Videostudio at 
DECT:1160. Please be aware that this is no support hotline.

-when theres a cut of presenters, camera#X should focus on a logo from the festival, or we mix in the logo from the 4th machine
-no questions should be asked withouth microphone
-if the irc channel gets "delocalized" i thin one should leave as is
-easy ambient track comes at breaks
