From 25c3

Are the streams not working? Then please check on these things:

    * Are there any lectures right now? Check the schedule! (add link to it!)
    * Is the (internal) network up and running? (link to status.xml de icecast?)
    * Is there no data from the streams? (no entiendo esta pregunta, es muy abierta)

If there actually are lectures happening, the network is up and there is yet no data - only then call the Videostudio at 
DECT:1160. Please be aware that this is no support hotline.

-when theres a cut of presenters, camera#X should focus on a logo from the festival, or we mix in the logo from the 4th machine
-no questions should be asked withouth microphone
-if the irc channel gets "delocalized" i thin one should leave as is
-easy ambient track comes at breaks if its a long one then  better a slide/clip with info about when the streams will come up again

+idea: using a fair background besides the speaker can offer us the chance to overlay the chat to the stream, this will make people watching the stream about the IRC


\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

the stream for the second day of the 25c3 came as:
VIDEO:  [WMV3]  384x288  24bpp  1000.000 fps  350.0 kbps (42.7 kbyte/s)

+calibrar el audio de los 2 rooms, es decir, si cambio de un stream al otro el nivel del audio debera ser similar. (in an ideal world)
+if audio is bad from the presenter, we should have a nice and politte way to come and fix things with the presenter
+what happens if there are technical problems not related to the stream, should we leave on all the troubleshooting? we 
bring down the audio? we stop the stream? i guess second option and an message.
