notes on getting linux running on a thinkpad w500

the hardware description page is:

After having my usual rant against debian, and wishing i could only had gentoo on this machine, 
i decided to make 3 partitions out of the 320gig HD.. unfortunately spinning at 5400rpm (the only flaw i can see on the configuration).


KERNEL:


VIDEO CARD ISSUE:

"The ThinkPad W500 is designed to provide users with best-class graphics performance achieved by AMD's Mobility FireGL V5700 graphics chip. 
The fundamental design of ThinkPad W500's graphics was based on AMD's Mobility Radeon HD3650 graphics chip. Extended graphics logic 
and functionality were added to activate the FireGL graphics features. Due to a limitation, the operating system is not capable of differentiating 
between the AMD Mobility Radeon HD3650 and the FireGL V5700 graphics chips, therefore it reports the Mobility Radeon HD3650 in Device Manager 
or Display Properties dialogs. The graphics chip of this model is the Mobility FireGL V5700, which gives users the benefit of FireGL functions and performance."
