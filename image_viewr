mirage -- installed, works OK, can delete the original image from the SD, but can only open all the images, not a selection of images

gpicview -- installed, similar to above, it doesnt open all the images but can magically jump from one to the next one. no editing options

flphoto -- installed, works almost as i wanted, can get the images directly from the camera but can't remove the files directly from it. it has touch editing for cropping, sharpness and 
contrast. can save in png and jpeg.

pqiv -- nothing to say, --unmerged

xv -- cool interface but crashing, --unmerged
